# Dart XSD/WSDL Generator

***UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT***<br>
A tool that parses xsd/wsdl files and generates related Dart code. Created mainly to generate classes and methods for ONVIF specifications, but should work with any xsd.

Currently under heavy development and there are features missing. Contributions are welcome.
